# Contract Application:
Contract Application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

##  Problem Statement:

**Lesedi** works as a legal intern at **BMF Attorneys**. She is responsible for drawing up contracts between BMF Attorneys and their clients. Due to an increase in workload, Lesedi needs a faster way to draw up contracts and get them signed by the respective parties. She has decided to hire a skilled developer to **build a dynamic web application** that allows her to populate the following dynamic values:

- Name of client
- Contract start and end date
- Service cost
- Service description

## Description:

I will build a dynamic web application that allows Lesedi to use input boxes, in the contract template, to fill the dynamic values.

## Tech-Stack:
 I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete the project.

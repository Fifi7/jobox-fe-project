# Contract Application:
Contract Application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

##  Problem Statement:

**Lesedi** works as a legal intern at **BMF Attorneys**. She is responsible for drawing up contracts between BMF Attorneys and their clients. Due to an increase in workload, Lesedi needs a faster way to draw up contracts and get them signed by the respective parties. She has decided to hire a skilled developer to **build a dynamic web application** that allows her to populate the following dynamic values:

- Name of client
- Contract start and end date
- Service cost
- Service description

## Description:

I will build a dynamic web application that allows Lesedi to use input boxes, in the contract template, to fill the dynamic values.

## Optional Feauture:

I have added a download button that will allow Lesedi to download the contract in PDF Format. I used the html2pdf library to achieve this functionality.

## Challenges:

The downloaded contract displays 4 pages instead of 3 pages, and the 4th page is empty.


## Tech-Stack:
 I  used  HTML, CSS, bootstrap and JavaScript to complete the project.
